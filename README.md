xmpp-roster-migrater
=============

A simple Python tool for listing your XMPP roster contacts and export it to another account. You can use it to easily backup list of your buddies.

This program is in development and no warranty can be made about it. Run it at your own risks.

It is a fork from Kamil PÃ¡ral's jabber-roster (https://github.com/kparal/jabber-roster) which is licensed under AGPL licence as well.

Running
=======

You can run the tool directly simply by:

    $ ./xmpp_roster_migrater.py

or by:

    $ python xmpp_roster_migrater.py

(use `--help` option of course if you don't know this tool yet)


Installation
============

For now on, it is only possible to install it through git on github/framagit.
To install, type 'git clone https://framagit.org/e-Jim/xmpp-roster-migrater'




Dependencies
============

If you haven't used the recommended way of installation, you might need to manually install some dependencies:

 * xmpppy: <http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/> (usually available as `python-xmpp` package)

**PLEASE NOTE**: Currently it is necessary to install `xmpppy` from a forked
project <https://github.com/ArchipelProject/xmpppy> instead of the official
upstream project, because it does not contain
[a fix for latest SSL changes](https://github.com/ArchipelProject/xmpppy/commit/c61c64972b12d3bfeca7200a18965886cbf51263).
Once it is updated (if it is), you can go back to using original `xmpppy`.
